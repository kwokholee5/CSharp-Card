# Question Validation Error - Fix Applied

## üêõ **Problem Identified**

The application was failing to load questions with this error:
```
ValidationError: Invalid question data provided
DataLoadError: Failed to load data from question paths
```

**Root Cause:** The `QuestionParser.ts` validation was rejecting questions with difficulty levels 6-10, as it only accepted difficulty values between 1-5.

## ‚úÖ **Fix Applied**

### **1. Updated Difficulty Range Validation**
**File:** `src/repositories/QuestionParser.ts`
**Line:** 169

**Before:**
```typescript
if (typeof rawQuestion.difficulty !== 'number' || rawQuestion.difficulty < 1 || rawQuestion.difficulty > 5) {
  errors.push('Difficulty must be a number between 1 and 5');
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (typeof rawQuestion.difficulty !== 'number' || rawQuestion.difficulty < 1 || rawQuestion.difficulty > 10) {
  errors.push('Difficulty must be a number between 1 and 10');
}
```

### **2. Updated Difficulty Mapping**
**File:** `src/repositories/QuestionParser.ts`
**Lines:** 267-285

**Before:** Only handled difficulty 1-5
**After:** Now handles difficulty 1-10 with proper mapping:

```typescript
private mapDifficulty(difficulty: number): QuestionDifficulty {
  switch (difficulty) {
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
      return 'easy';      // Basics (1-3)
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      return 'medium';    // Intermediate (4-6)  
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
    case 10:
      return 'hard';      // Advanced/Expert (7-10)
    default:
      return 'medium';
  }
}
```

## üìä **Question Difficulty Distribution**

| Difficulty Range | Category | Count | Mapping |
|------------------|----------|-------|---------|
| 1-3 | Basics | ~40 questions | ‚Üí `easy` |
| 4-6 | Intermediate/Advanced | ~35 questions | ‚Üí `medium` |
| 7-10 | Expert | ~30 questions | ‚Üí `hard` |

## üöÄ **Expected Result**

The application should now:
1. ‚úÖ Successfully load all 105 questions 
2. ‚úÖ Display: "Successfully loaded 105 questions"
3. ‚úÖ Show questions from all difficulty levels in the UI
4. ‚úÖ Properly categorize difficulty as easy/medium/hard

## üîß **What Was Wrong Before**

Our generated questions included:
- **Advanced questions:** difficulty 6 (async/await, generics)
- **Expert questions:** difficulty 7-9 (reflection, advanced patterns)

But the validator was hardcoded to only accept difficulty 1-5, causing all advanced/expert questions to fail validation.

## ‚úÖ **Validation Fixed**

The application can now properly handle the full spectrum of C# questions from basic console output to expert-level reflection and IL generation.

**Test the fix:** Restart the application and check the console for "Successfully loaded 105 questions"!
