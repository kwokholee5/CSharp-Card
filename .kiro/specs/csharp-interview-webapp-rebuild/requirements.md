# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for rebuilding a C# technical interview revision webapp from scratch. The application will be a mobile-first, landscape-oriented single-page application that presents multiple-choice questions with code examples to help users practice C# technical interview questions. The rebuild focuses on implementing proper Object-Oriented Programming principles and SOLID design patterns while maintaining a clean, maintainable codebase structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a C# developer preparing for technical interviews, I want to practice multiple-choice questions in a clean, distraction-free interface, so that I can focus entirely on learning without navigation overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a single-page interface with no headers, footers, or scrolling
2. WHEN the application is accessed THEN the system SHALL present the question interface immediately without additional landing pages
3. WHEN the interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a 2-column layout optimized for landscape mobile viewing
4. IF the user attempts to scroll THEN the system SHALL prevent scrolling and keep all content within the viewport

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user reviewing C# concepts, I want to see questions and code examples clearly separated from answer options, so that I can read and understand the problem before selecting my answer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the question text in the left column
2. IF a question has a code example THEN the system SHALL display the code in the left column below the question text
3. WHEN code is displayed THEN the system SHALL use proper syntax highlighting for C# code
4. WHEN the left column content is shown THEN the system SHALL ensure all content fits within the column without scrolling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user taking a multiple-choice quiz, I want to see answer options in an organized grid layout, so that I can easily compare and select from the available choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN answer options are displayed THEN the system SHALL show them in the right column
2. WHEN there are multiple options THEN the system SHALL arrange them in a 2x2 grid layout
3. WHEN there are 4 or fewer options THEN the system SHALL display all options within the grid
4. WHEN a user selects an option THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for the selected state
5. WHEN an option is selected THEN the system SHALL allow both single and multiple selection based on question type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner wanting to understand my mistakes, I want to see detailed explanations after submitting my answer, so that I can learn from incorrect responses and reinforce correct understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an answer THEN the system SHALL replace the options in the right column with the explanation
2. WHEN the explanation is shown THEN the system SHALL highlight the correct answer(s)
3. WHEN the explanation is displayed THEN the system SHALL show detailed reasoning for why the answer is correct
4. WHEN the explanation appears THEN the system SHALL provide two action buttons: "Redo Question" and "Next Question"

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user practicing questions, I want simple navigation controls to either retry the current question or move to the next one, so that I can control my learning pace effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the "Redo Question" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL reset the current question to its initial state with options visible
2. WHEN the "Next Question" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL load and display the next available question
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interface layout and behavior
4. WHEN questions are navigated THEN the system SHALL not require any progress tracking between sessions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content maintainer, I want to easily add and modify C# interview questions, so that the question database can be expanded and updated without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN questions are stored THEN the system SHALL use the existing JSON format for compatibility
2. WHEN new questions are added THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in the question pool
3. WHEN questions contain code examples THEN the system SHALL support proper formatting and syntax highlighting
4. WHEN the question database is modified THEN the system SHALL not require application rebuilding to reflect changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this application, I want the codebase to follow Object-Oriented Programming and SOLID principles, so that the application is maintainable, testable, and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL implement proper class-based architecture with clear responsibilities
2. WHEN classes are designed THEN the system SHALL follow Single Responsibility Principle with each class having one clear purpose
3. WHEN interfaces are created THEN the system SHALL follow Interface Segregation Principle with focused, specific contracts
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL follow Dependency Inversion Principle with abstractions over concrete implementations
5. WHEN code is extended THEN the system SHALL follow Open/Closed Principle allowing extension without modification
6. WHEN substitutions are made THEN the system SHALL follow Liskov Substitution Principle ensuring derived classes can replace base classes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer deploying this application, I want the build output to be optimized for static hosting on Cloudflare, so that the application can be easily deployed and served efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL generate static files suitable for CDN deployment
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL optimize assets for fast loading on mobile devices
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL work correctly when served from Cloudflare's edge network
4. WHEN assets are loaded THEN the system SHALL minimize bundle size for optimal mobile performance
