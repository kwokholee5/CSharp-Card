# Implementation Plan: Fix Flip Card Auto-Reset Issue

## Problem Statement
The RevisionCard component doesn't reset its flip state when navigating to the next question, causing the answer to remain visible. This breaks the study flow as users see answers before attempting questions.

## Goals
1. Ensure RevisionCard resets to unflipped state when question changes
2. Maintain SOLID principles and existing architecture
3. Preserve all current functionality while fixing the bug
4. Ensure proper coordination between components

## Success Criteria
1. Card automatically resets to show question (not answer) when navigating
2. All existing tests pass
3. New tests validate the reset behavior
4. No visual glitches during transitions
5. Keyboard navigation works correctly
6. Focus management is preserved

## Agent Team Assignments

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
**Lead Agent**: Orchestration Architect
- Coordinate all agent activities
- Define workflow and checkpoints
- Monitor progress and handle escalations

**Code Analyst Agent**
- Analyze current flip state management in RevisionCard.tsx
- Identify dependencies in SimpleFlipCardMode.tsx and Study.tsx
- Document state flow and component interactions
- Report findings to Orchestration Architect

### Phase 2: Test Development
**Test Automator Agent**
- Write comprehensive tests for flip reset behavior
- Test keyboard navigation scenarios
- Test rapid question changes
- Validate animation/transition handling
- Ensure TDD approach (RED phase)
- Report test results to Orchestration Architect

### Phase 3: Implementation
**React Developer Agent**
- Implement useEffect hook to monitor question prop changes
- Reset isFlipped state when question.id changes
- Ensure smooth transitions without glitches
- Maintain focus management
- Report implementation status to Orchestration Architect

### Phase 4: Code Review & Validation
**Architect Reviewer Agent**
- Validate SOLID principles compliance
- Check Single Responsibility: Each component has one reason to change
- Verify Open/Closed: Extension without modification
- Ensure Dependency Inversion: Components depend on abstractions
- Report validation results to Orchestration Architect

**Code Reviewer Agent**
- Review code quality and standards
- Check for proper error handling
- Validate naming conventions
- Ensure no hardcoded values
- Report review findings to Orchestration Architect

### Phase 5: Testing & Verification
**Test Automator Agent**
- Run all tests (GREEN phase)
- Verify flip reset tests pass
- Check existing functionality preserved
- Test integration between components
- Report all test results to Orchestration Architect

### Phase 6: Documentation & Completion
**Documentation Agent**
- Update any affected documentation
- Record implementation decisions
- Document test coverage
- Report completion to Orchestration Architect

## Workflow Sequence

```
1. Code Analyst → Analyze components (15 min)
   ↓
2. Test Automator → Write failing tests (20 min)
   ↓
3. React Developer → Implement fix (15 min)
   ↓
4. Architect Reviewer + Code Reviewer → Parallel validation (10 min)
   ↓
5. Test Automator → Run all tests (10 min)
   ↓
6. Documentation Agent → Update docs (5 min)
   ↓
7. Orchestration Architect → Final verification
```

## Coordination Rules

### Handoff Specifications
- Each agent must provide status report upon completion
- Include any blockers or concerns in reports
- Use structured format for data exchange

### Quality Gates
1. Tests must be written before implementation (TDD)
2. All tests must pass before proceeding
3. SOLID principles must be validated
4. Code review must approve changes

### Error Handling
- Maximum 3 attempts per issue
- Escalate to Orchestration Architect if blocked
- Document all issues encountered

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes Required

1. **RevisionCard.tsx**
   - Add useEffect hook to monitor question prop
   - Reset isFlipped when question.id changes
   - Preserve all other functionality

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Test flip reset on question change
   - Test keyboard navigation scenarios
   - Test rapid question changes
   - Test animation handling

### Code Structure
```typescript
// In RevisionCard.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  setIsFlipped(false);
}, [question.id]);
```

## Risk Mitigation
- Minimal code changes to existing components
- Comprehensive test coverage before implementation
- Parallel review processes for efficiency
- Clear rollback plan if issues arise

## Status Tracking
- [x] Phase 1: Analysis Complete
- [x] Phase 2: Tests Written  
- [x] Phase 3: Implementation Done
- [x] Phase 4: Reviews Passed
- [x] Phase 5: All Tests Green
- [x] Phase 6: Documentation Updated

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made
1. **RevisionCard.tsx**:
   - Added `useEffect` import
   - Added useEffect hook to reset `isFlipped` state when `question.id` changes
   - Added null check for undefined question prop
   - Fixed difficulty rendering to handle undefined question

2. **Test Updates**:
   - Updated tests to check CSS class instead of visibility
   - Fixed all test assertions to properly validate flip state reset
   - All 8 tests now passing

### Results
- ✅ Card automatically resets to unflipped state when navigating
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No visual glitches during transitions
- ✅ Keyboard navigation works correctly
- ✅ Focus management preserved
- ✅ SOLID principles maintained
- ✅ Application builds successfully

## Notes
- Follow WORKFLOW.md 7-step process
- All agents report to Orchestration Architect
- Maintain focus on minimal, targeted fix
- Preserve existing architecture
