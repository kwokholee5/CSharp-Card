| Phase | Name | Status | Start | End | Progress | Owner |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-----|----------|-------|
| 1 | Planning & Architecture | 🟡 Active | 2025-08-29 | - | 75% | System Architect |
| 2 | Data Layer Implementation | ⏸️ Pending | - | - | 0% | Data Architect |
| 3 | Service Layer Enhancement | ⏸️ Pending | - | - | 0% | System Architect |
| 4 | Component Architecture | ⏸️ Pending | - | - | 0% | Frontend Architect |
| 5 | State Management | ⏸️ Pending | - | - | 0% | Frontend Architect |
| 6 | Integration & Testing | ⏸️ Pending | - | - | 0% | Test Automator |
| 7 | Documentation & Deployment | ⏸️ Pending | - | - | 0% | Documentation Specialist |

## Completed Milestones
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow removed (Task 1)
- ✅ IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md created
- ✅ Orchestration plan defined
- 🔄 MASTER_TRACKER.md created (current)

## Current Sprint Tasks
- [ ] Complete TASK_BREAKDOWN.md
- [ ] Review and finalize data structures
- [ ] Create initial type definitions
- [ ] Set up test framework

## Blockers & Risks
| Issue | Severity | Status | Resolution |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| None currently | - | - | - |

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Storage Format**: Extend existing JSON structure with `questionType` field
2. **Architecture Pattern**: Abstract base classes with Strategy pattern
3. **Component Structure**: Separate mode components extending abstract base
4. **State Management**: Extend existing LocalStorage implementation

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality
- Test Coverage: -% (target: >90%)
- Linting Errors: 0
- Type Coverage: 100%
- Bundle Size Impact: TBD

### SOLID Compliance
- [ ] Single Responsibility validated
- [ ] Open/Closed principle applied
- [ ] Liskov Substitution verified
- [ ] Interface Segregation implemented
- [ ] Dependency Inversion confirmed

## Agent Assignments

### Active Agents
- **Orchestration Architect**: Overall coordination
- **System Architect**: Architecture validation
- **Documentation Specialist**: Tracking updates

### Standby Agents
- Data Architect
- Frontend Architect
- Test Automator
- Code Reviewer
- TypeScript Specialist
- UI/UX Designer
- Performance Analyst

## Communication Log
| Time | Agent | Message | Action |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| 06:38 | Orchestration | Task 1 complete - workflow removed | ✅ |
| 06:39 | Orchestration | IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN created | ✅ |
| 06:40 | Orchestration | MASTER_TRACKER initialized | 🔄 |

## Next Phase Entry Criteria
### Phase 2: Data Layer
- [ ] TASK_BREAKDOWN.md complete
- [ ] Type definitions approved
- [ ] Test framework ready
- [ ] All Phase 1 documentation reviewed

## Dependencies
- None currently blocking

## Resource Utilization
- Development Environment: Active
- Testing Environment: Not yet configured
- CI/CD Pipeline: Manual (GitHub Actions removed)

## Performance Benchmarks
- Build Time: ~3 seconds
- Mode Switch Target: <200ms
- Question Load Target: <100ms
- Current Performance: Baseline not yet measured

## Review Schedule
- Daily standup: Start of each phase
- Phase review: End of each phase
- Final review: Phase 7 completion

## Notes
- Following strict OOP/SOLID principles throughout
- Prioritizing extensibility over quick implementation
- All agents must report through Orchestration Architect
- Continuous documentation updates required
